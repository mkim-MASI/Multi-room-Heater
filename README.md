# Multi-room-Heater

Used MATLAB version 2022a

No special instructions to run the execuatble, simply run it and the program will ask you for inputs (u = outside temp, hi, i={1, 2, 3, 4} are the initial heater placements). Make sure to have the sum of all hi be exactly 2 (ex: [0 1 1 0]). There are no checks for this, but you should do it for thr program to run properly. Also, choose a reasonable value for u (e.g. u = 6 is normal). Anything too large will result in the room temperatures becoming unbounded.
